# Amazon Clone (Front-End Only)

This is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to recreate the look and feel of a real-world e-commerce platform while focusing on clean layout, responsive design, and visual accuracy â€” all without JavaScript or a backend.

Features
- Custom navigation bar with search functionality UI
